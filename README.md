React Native app built with expo, Redux, Redux Thunk, and hooks. This is for G2i's Trivia Game Coding Challenge. [All app specs and requirements can be viewed on their gist.](https://gist.github.com/severnsc/e09f4f8742b7dd91af9c422d6f210a57)       

### Run a build on your phone

If you haven't already, install the [Expo Client](https://expo.io/) on your phone - go to the App Store or Play Store, search for "Expo" and install it. 

Be sure that your phone and computer are on the same wireless network. 

Run the following command on your comp 

`git clone https://github.com/GreanBeetle/trivia && cd trivia && npm install && npm start`

For iOS, scan the resulting QR code with the camera's built-in scanner. For Android, use the Expo app itself to scan the QR code. 

[For help troubleshooting, refer to the React Native documentation.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)

### A note on TypeScript usage 

_WIP_ TypeScript was used for much of the business logic in the application. _WIP_

### A note on Expo 

_WIP_ As required by the specs, this project uses Expo. However, for the following reasons I typically don't use Expo. _WIP_  

- In my opinion, a minimum knowledge of Xcode and the use of certificates and profiles is critical for a React Native Developer. Using Expo, developers aren't exposed to this. 
- A similar argument applies for Android Studio. 
- Reproducing and troubleshooting real-world bugs involving different mobile OSes, for example, or dated or rarely-seen hardware is more difficult with Expo.  
- Expo makes it hard to debug network issues related to WiFi or Data. 
- Developing applications that make extensive use of phone hardware - such as bluetooth or NFC modules - is unnecessarily difficult with Expo.
