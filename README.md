React Native app built with expo, Redux, Redux Thunk, and hooks. This is for G2i's Trivia Game Coding Challenge. [All app specs and requirements can be viewed on their gist.](https://gist.github.com/severnsc/e09f4f8742b7dd91af9c422d6f210a57)       

### note regarding TypeScript 

TypeScript was used for much of the business logic in the application. However, due to time constraints, I did attempt to use TypeScript when defining things like functional components or implementing the Navigation architecture. These are implemented using straight up JS. 

### run a build on your mobile device

If you haven't already, install the [Expo Client](https://expo.io/) on your phone - go to the App Store or Play Store, search for "Expo" and install it. 

Be sure that your phone and computer are on the same wireless network. 

Run the following commands on your comp 

- `git clone https://github.com/GreanBeetle/trivia`
- `cd trivia`
- `npm run start`

For iOS, scan the resulting QR code with the camera's built-in scanner. For Android, use the Expo app itself to scan the QR code. 

[For help troubleshooting, refer to the React Native documentation.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
